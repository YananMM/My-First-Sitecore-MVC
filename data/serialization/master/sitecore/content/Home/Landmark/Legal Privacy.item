<br>
As part of offering and providing customisable and personalised services, Hongkong Land uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive.

<p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those services that require registration in order to participate. <br>
<br>
Hongkong Land may use the information collected for one or more of the following purposes:- <br>
<br>

2. for Hongkong Land's own marketing, research, promotional and customer relationship management purposes, compiling statistics and analysis purposes, conducting customer surveys and marketing activities; <br>
<br>
3. for responding to you by email, mail, fax, phone or other means in respect of your enquiry or comment previously communicated to Hongkong Land; <br>
<br>
4. for any other incidental or associated purposes relating to the above and any other purpose which a customer or a service recipient may from time to time agree; and/or <br>
<br>
5. other purposes directly related to the purposes specified above. <br>
<br>
Hongkong Land will not use, share, sell or rent your personal data provided to Hongkong Land in ways unrelated to the purposes aforementioned.</p>

With whom does Hongkong Land share information? <br>
<br>
As a general rule, Hongkong Land will not disclose any of your personal information outside Hongkong Land and Hongkong Land's service providers ("Third Party Service Providers") except when Hongkong Land has your permission or under special circumstances, such as when Hongkong Land believes in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.
