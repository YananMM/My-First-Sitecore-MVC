<p>Having spent almost 15 years as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Angelina Jolie has created global awareness for the plight of children, the poor and millions of refugees around the world. Not only has she discussed policy and relief efforts with leading politicians in Third World regions, but she has also donated upwards of US$20 million of her personal fortune to humanitarian organisations such as those providing food and shelter to people caught in the middle of conflict zones or drought-stricken areas. At least US$5 million of that money has gone directly to the UNHCR alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People often put down charity as a responsibility, but the truth is it benefits your own soul and your own knowledge of life,&rdquo; says Jolie, 40. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned more from refugees than anybody in my life &ndash; more about being a mother, a stronger person, survival &ndash; so I can only hope to give something back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jolie adds that, as an A-list Hollywood star, she &ldquo;felt a visceral need&rdquo; to &ldquo;escape the bubble I had been living in&rdquo; and do good in the world. &ldquo;Without my work in places like Africa and Cambodia and elsewhere,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;I would have lived a very shallow life and felt empty. My work for UNHCR has given me so much purpose, and I feel honoured to have been able to help bring some relief and hope to the survivors of war and refugees and children who are suffering so much around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this kind of personal commitment that has made Jolie one of the world&rsquo;s most important humanitarians. Her high profile attracts millions in donations from wealthy individuals and corporations, while she has personally lobbied the leaders of both developed and developing nations to ramp up efforts to take care of the world&rsquo;s most helpless and defenceless citizens.</p>
<p>Together with husband Brad Pitt, Jolie has created a family that itself is a miniature version of the League of Nations. Their eldest son, Maddox, now 14, was adopted in 2002 while Jolie was visiting his native country of Cambodia. Daughter Zahara comes from Ethiopia, where Jolie spent months involved with relief efforts in the drought-stricken and war-ravaged region. Shiloh, Pitt and Jolie&rsquo;s first biological child, was born in Namibia while she and the actor were exploring Africa together. The couple then adopted their son Pax from Vietnam in 2007, and Jolie gave birth to twins Knox and Vivienne in Nice, France, in 2008.</p>
<p>Together, she says, her six children are &ldquo;my beautiful world family, and my love for them is as great as my love and dedication to children all over the world who have no parents and very little prospect of leading a happy life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jolie places great importance on making sure that her children are aware of the significance of her official visits, and has even been known to bring them with her on humanitarian trips. &ldquo;When I go on UN missions, I always sit down with [the children] and explain where I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; says Jolie. &ldquo;They often know about that particular area, especially from watching the news, so they&rsquo;re pretty well informed. I tell them I&rsquo;m going to meet with other kids like them to make sure everyone is okay. Sometimes they give me little things to bring as gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jolie adds that she is actively attempting to make her children globally aware. &ldquo;My mother [the late actress and producer Marcheline Bertrand], as open as she was, we just didn&rsquo;t travel much, but she always taught me to be a good person and was interested in a lot of things,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;She took me to my first Amnesty International dinner when I was nine. She was part Native American and always talked to me about issues, but didn&rsquo;t live outside of America. We weren&rsquo;t as at home in the world. </p>
<p>&ldquo;With my family, I&rsquo;m trying to raise them to have respect for all people, and to make friends around the world and to feel at home around the world. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s forming them. Of course, I make sure they do their math and their science, but the world perspective is the most important thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since being appointed a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in 2001, Jolie has visited more than 20 countries to perform her role. Pitt, meanwhile, is one of the founders of Not On Our Watch, an organisation that aims to focus global attention and resources on stopping and preventing genocide, such as that seen in Darfur. In 2006, the couple set up the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which has donated large sums of money to various conservation groups and organisations such as Doctors Without Borders. In recognition of her work, Jolie received the Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee in 2007.</p>
<p>In addition to her work for UNHCR, Jolie continues to travel to observe and support disaster relief, vulnerable children, environmental conservation and international law and justice efforts worldwide. In 2003, she started the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation project dedicated to conservation in Cambodia, which later expanded to include agriculture, education, healthcare, vocational training, infrastructure, rural planning and microcredit programmes.</p>
<p>Two years later, she launched the National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children, an organisation that provides free legal aid to young asylum seekers. And in 2008, she partnered with Microsoft to launch Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a pro bono movement of law firms, corporate law departments, NGOs and volunteers committed to providing legal advice to unaccompanied immigrant children in the United States. She also co-chairs the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which helps fund education programmes for children affected by war.</p>
<p>Her unending devotion to humanitarian work is driven by a heartfelt desire to contribute to finding solutions to ongoing and increasingly desperate refugee crises in Africa, Asia and now Syria. It&rsquo;s a humanitarian journey that makes Jolie one of the most important non-governmental leaders in the fight to help refugees and provide aid for the world&rsquo;s most despairing populations.</p>
<p>It is, admits Jolie, a long way from the trappings of Hollywood. And for that she is thankful. &ldquo;I was looking for something that I could point to, and to find a purpose and direction for myself,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I enjoyed acting but it always seemed that the characters I was playing had much more interesting lives than I had. So when I started working with UNHCR and doing humanitarian work, I felt that I was finally able to do something very real and constructive with my life, and accomplish something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Angelina Jolie毫无疑问是21世纪第一位公认的性感女神，任何时候都受到世界各地传媒关注，尤其是跟荷李活巨星丶现任丈夫Brad Pitt传出恋情後，一举一动都牵动传媒的神经。这位奥斯卡得奖演员是荷李活少数能在艺术电影和卖座商业电影中取得平衡的女星，单凭她在电影界的成就，已无愧「经典偶像」这个称号。然而，演员的身份只是她人生的其中一部分，这些年她对各地社会的贡献，影响之深远，早已超越她的演艺成就。</p>
<p>担任联合国难民署亲善大使接近15年，Angelina成功唤醒公众，令他们关注世界各地生活在水深火热中的儿童丶贫穷人口，以及数以百万计的难民。她不仅跟第三世界地区的政治领袖讨论相关政策及援助方案，更出力又出钱，向多个人道组织捐出超过2,000万美元，为饱受战乱和旱灾影响的难民提供粮食和庇护。联合国难民署亦是受惠机构之一，获得她至少500万美元的捐款。</p>
<p>年方四十的Angelina表示：「很多人以为行善是一种责任，但其实乐善好施不仅裨益我们的心灵，也会让我们更了解人生。难民教会我的东西比任何人都要多，他们让我成为更好的母亲丶更坚强的人，对生存有更多体会。我希望可以回馈他们。」</p>
<p>她又说，作为荷李活红星，她「内心深处渴望」能够「逃离自己一直活在的泡沫」，对世界作出一些贡献。她说：「如果没有非洲和柬埔寨等地的慈善工作，我会活得很肤浅丶很空洞。联合国难民署的工作为我的人生带来目标，能够帮助战乱中的生还者丶全球正在受苦的难民和小孩，为他们带来希望，我觉得与有荣焉。」</p>
<p>Angelina对慈善工作的热忱使她成为全球最重要的人道主义者之一，她的知名度吸引不少富豪和商业机构慷慨解囊，成功为慈善团体带来数以百万计的捐款。她又游说已发展及发展中国家尽力照顾世界各地最无依无助的一群。</p>
<p>Angelina跟丈夫Brad Pitt组成的家庭也仿如小型联合国。现年14岁的长子Maddox生於柬埔寨，是2002年她访问该国时领养的。而在饱受乾旱和战乱蹂躏的埃塞俄比亚进行为期数月的援助工作，则促成她收养长女Zahara。次女Shiloh是她和Brad的第一个亲生孩子，在纳米比亚出生，当时夫妇俩正在非洲游历。2007年，他们在越南收养了儿子Pax。2008年，Angelina在法国尼斯诞下双胞胎Knox和Vivienne。</p>
<p>这位女星形容，她的六个孩子是「世界本是一家的最佳体验，我疼爱他们，如同我疼爱全球各地无父无母丶前景无望的儿童」。</p>
<p>她坚持让子女了解她为联合国难民署出访的意义，甚至多次带着他们参与人道救援工作。她说：「每次参加联合国的任务前，我都会坐下来跟孩子讲解我要到哪里去。很多时候他们都对我要出访的地方略有所闻，多数是在新闻里听过有关地方，因此很清楚我的人道工作。我告诉他们，我会去探望当地的小朋友，确保大家都生活安好。有时候他们会给我一些小礼物，让我带去送给当地的孩子。」</p>
<p>Angelina补充，她希望培养儿女成为世界公民。她说：「我妈妈（已故演员兼监制Marcheline Bertrand）虽然很开明，但我们很少出国。她常常教导我要做一个正直善良的人，并且对许多事物都很感兴趣。第一次参加国际特赦组织的晚宴，也是她带我去的，当时我只有九岁。她有美国原住民血统，常常告诉我各地发生的大事，但却从没在美国以外的地方生活过，因为在其他地方总让她觉得不自在。」</p>
<p>「我教导自己的小孩要尊重所有人，鼓励他们结识不同地方的朋友，并学会在世界任何一个地方生活也可以泰然自若，因为他们是世界的一分子。当然，他们也会如常学习数学和科学等科目，但我认为培养他们的全球视野始终最重要。」</p>
<p>自2001年获委任为联合国难民署亲善大使以来，她为了履行职责，探访了逾20个国家。与此同时，Brad也是慈善组织Not On Our Watch的创办人之一；这个组织致力提升公众对苏丹达尔富尔等种族灭绝行为的关注，并投放资源制止和预防同类暴行。2006年，夫妇二人更成立基金会Jolie-Pitt Foundation，慷慨捐助保育团体丶无国界医生等组织。2007年，为了肯定Angelina的贡献，国际救援会将自由大奖颁发给这位女英雌。</p>
<p>除了联合国难民署的工作，Angelina亦不时到不同国家观察和支援各项工作，如救灾丶救助弱势儿童丶环境保护，以至国际法律在各地的落实情况。2003年，她成立了Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation，专注在柬埔寨推行保育计划，其後支援工作更推广至农业丶教育丶医疗丶职业训练丶基建丶农村规划和小额贷款等多个范畴。</p>
<p>两年後，她又成立了National Center for Refugee and Immigrant Children，为寻求庇护的少年提供免费法律支援。2008年，她跟微软公司合作成立Kids in Need of Defense（简称KIND），与律师事务所丶大企业的法律部门丶非政府组织和义工等携手为只身来到美国又无依无靠的儿童提供免费法律谘询。另外，她又担任Education Partnership for Children of Conflict的联合主席，为受战火影响的儿童筹募教育经费。</p>
<p>眼见非洲丶亚洲和现时的敍利亚等地持续出现难民问题，情况又日趋绝望，促使她不断投入人道工作，期望为解决难民问题出一分力。Angelina多年来积极参与救援工作，在救助难民丶支援弱势社群方面，早已成为全球最具影响力的非政府领袖之一。</p>
<p>她坦言，这种跟荷李活的金光灿烂截然不同的生活，对她而言是好事并心存感激。她说：「我以前就想为自己的生活找个重点，为人生找个目标和方向。我喜欢演戏，但电影中的角色好像永远比我的人生精采，直到加入联合国难民署，开始参与人道救援项目之後，才终於觉得自己能够为世界做一点实事，感到有所作为。」</p>
