<p>Bruno Frisoni has been creative director at venerable French shoe, bag and accessories house Roger Vivier for more than a decade. Previously heading up his own eponymous label, Frisoni is known for returning Vivier&rsquo;s famed stiletto heel and buckle to the limelight with sexy, fantastical yet incredibly wearable and comfortable shoes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When did you know you wanted to be in fashion?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t good at school. I didn&rsquo;t want to listen to anybody, and that has never changed. I stopped going to school without saying anything to my parents. When they found out, they realised I had not been happy in what I was doing. So my family decided to go to Paris, and that I would go to art school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved singers, actors, people, glamour . . . I was always looking at the way people presented themselves. I would spend days alone drawing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The autumn/winter collection is both masculine and feminine. What&rsquo;s behind this duality?</strong></p>
<p>In Roger Vivier&rsquo;s story [this season], there is one icon and that&rsquo;s Catherine Deneuve. She embodies the style of the Saint Laurent period, of <em>Belle de Jour</em> mainly. She&rsquo;s exactly what many young women want to be in their heads: witty inside, but polite outside. Strong, wearing the &ldquo;in&rdquo; clothes, maybe, but in a very proper way. </p>
<p>I wanted to propose a new take on <em>Belle de Jour</em>. That&rsquo;s why I brought these knee-high legging boots with the buckle, instead of the proper d&eacute;collet&eacute;. Today, if you think of a beautiful woman&rsquo;s dress, you might put sneakers with it. If you wear jeans, you would break things up with ultra-feminine, evening-style heels. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about Rendez-Vous, originally launched as Roger Vivier&rsquo;s haute couture collection. </strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually something of a revolution for me. We started Rendez-Vous because I didn&rsquo;t feel like couture should be a part of Roger Vivier[&rsquo;s main collection]. I felt we needed to change the format. It&rsquo;s been quite successful but it was difficult to travel with the collection during trunk shows and to catch the client at the right moments.</p>
<p>So we decided that, after its success, it had to be part of the main collection. Rendez-Vous spring/summer 2016 is still Rendez-Vous, with a focus on the details and the workmanship, but it is closer to the main collection and not limited in quantity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you could pick one item from Rendez-Vous and one from AW15, what would they be?</strong></p>
<p>The Ecstasy [from Rendez-Vous SS16] and the gold knee-high Grace flat boot for AW15. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, is there anything you hope or want to achieve before, say, the end of time? </strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a day-by-day person, so I never think of the end of time. Somebody came into the studio recently. She repeated a phrase she had heard somewhere: &ldquo;Paradise is now.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not yesterday. It&rsquo;s not tomorrow. It&rsquo;s now. I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful motto, because you have to be happy with what&rsquo;s happening in the moment.</p>
